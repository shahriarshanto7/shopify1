   <p>Hi, I’m Shahriar shanto, I’m a Creative Community Manager, Facebook ads, google ads, Shopify worker. I have more than two years of experience in the marketing area.
i’m a creative community manager, facebook ads, google ads, shopify worker. i have more than two years of experience in the marketing area. everyone has hobbies, different dreams, so their careers are not similar. they can be engineers, actors even farmers. one of the attractive professions for young people today is business. in my opinion, business is an interesting career. i’m not an expert, i’m involved because i like, i like to do what i want and follow it. simply that. but i have to try my best as well as accumulate experience continuously. besides, i can create and help you grow the community . i can write articles, create videos, make infographic, sticker.
